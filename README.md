An upcoming Minecraft mod providing a variety of useful features for worldbuilding themed servers.

## Features

- User or Admin definable groups, which can act as:
  - Guilds
  - Towns
  - Nations
  - Cultures
  - And whatever else your heart desires
- Admin configurable in-game calendar system: Broadcast holidays and other important dates, or toggle weather or other events on days you choose.
